Lower VHF band lower limits - In Chirp, Settings -> Other Settings -> VHF Lower Limit -> change from 136 to 126. 
Increase VHF band upper limits - In Chirp, Settings -> Other Settings -> VHF Upper Limit -> change from 174 to 226.
Lower UHF band lower limits - In Chirp, Settings -> Other Settings -> UHF Lower Limit -> change from 400 to 383. 
Increase UHF band upper limits - In Chirp, Settings -> Other Settings -> UHF Upper Limit -> change from 520 to 545.
Note - These limits appear to be safe for most radios.  If the limit is set too far out of bounds the radio locks up until the number is changed.  The extension covers the 1.25 meter band and the radio will attempt to transmit on this frequency but in my testing the power output is so low that it did not register on my meter. It will receive on these frequencies without issue.
